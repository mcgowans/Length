# Length
## A C# class library for dealing with physical lengths.

This project started as a way to encapsulate the various ways we deal with lengths in the
printing industry, but it should be flexible enough to handle any physical length.

It aims to be a very simple library to be used as a basic building block for more complex
applications.
